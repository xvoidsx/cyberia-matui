An opinionated [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) TUI, dressed in nightshadeNeon.
The UI is kept as simple as possible and there's no mouse support (yet, at
least). With the assumption that usually only the last couple messages
actually matter, vertical space is not conserved at all.

Cyberia is a friendly fork of [matui](https://github.com/pkulak/matui) by
Phil Kulak, maintained by [xvoidsx](https://github.com/xvoidsx). Improvements
that fit upstream's vision are contributed back; the rest lives here.

# Who should use this client?

Anyone who wants a very simple terminal Matrix client with a neon soul.
Room administration beyond moderation (settings, power levels) is left to
other clients.

# Installation

## Releases

You can download the latest release, unpack it, and move `cyberia` to `/usr/bin`
(or anywhere else you like).

## From source

`cargo build --release` — the binary lands at `target/release/cyberia`.

# Keybindings

Modal UIs can be a bit overwhelming, but thankfully chat isn't terribly
complicated. Especially if you don't implement too many features.
